Darwin World
Description
Darwin World is an application simulating the evolution of life on a virtual map. Animals move, search for food, and reproduce, following the principles of evolution. The project is based on the concept of simulating a Darwinian world, where animals are equipped with genes that determine their behavior.

Features
World Simulation: The application allows running simulations on a virtual map, where animals move, eat plants, and reproduce according to predefined rules.
Configurability: Users can adjust various simulation parameters, such as map size, initial number of animals and plants, energy required for reproduction, plant growth strategies, animal behavior, etc.
Visualization: The application displays a visualization of the simulation, showing the positions of animals, their energy, and the distribution of plants on the map.
Statistics: For each simulation, statistics are available, such as the number of living animals, number of plants, average animal energy, average animal lifespan, most popular genotypes, etc.
Save and Replay: Users can save simulation configurations and results to a CSV file, allowing for later analysis of the data.
How to Run
Clone the repository to your local computer.
Open the project in a Java-supported Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
Compile and run the application.
Choose an existing configuration or create your own.
Run the simulation and observe the development of life on the virtual map.
Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.
Java-supported Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
